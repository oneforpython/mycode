### File Structure

When adding to this devops-the-alta3-way read me, structure is as follow:

```
labs/devops
├── config
├── css
├── csv
├── docker-compose
├── dockerfiles
├── drill
├── html
├── js
├── json
├── py
├── scripts
├── setup
└── yaml
```

Where the first entry is the top level directory **labs**, with the course **/devops**.

The rest of these directories contain files that are used in the labs via batcat.alta3.com.

Example of this is a file called *interesting_data.py* would go into the **py** directory.

If you had a *hello.go*, you would want to make a new **go** directory and place the file in there.
